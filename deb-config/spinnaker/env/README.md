# ENV files.
Our installations have a way to switch between different "environment profiles".
You'll need a file like /opt/spinnaker/env/ha.env (the name prod comes from the "stack" in a servergroup i.e. armoryspinnaker-ha-v999), so you can set any vars you need per each environment.

These env files are sourced during startup of the Spinnaker instance to each service.

### `default.env`
This file is autogenerated on start by Spinnaker's deploy stage's user-data field. It's meant to include any infrastructure values configured during the deployment. Potentially, some of these values can be moved to `ha.env` to allow for different spinnaker enviroments to use the same configuration repo.

### `ha.env`
This file includes any new environment variables that you'll need to provide.

### `resolved.env`
This file generated automatically and is a combination of:
- `/opt/spinnaker/env/default.env` (comes from user-data) 
- `ha.env` (if the server group name is `ha`)
- `bin/secrets` (this script is allowed to append to `/opt/spinnaker/env/default.env`)

It's passed to each microservice as env files, so later values will override prior values.
